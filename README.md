Here's a simplified breakdown of how to install Terraform using the official HashiCorp repository on a Linux system:
Step-by-Step Installation:

    Update your system and install necessary packages:
        Make sure your package list is up to date and install tools needed for verifying packages:

Add HashiCorp's GPG key:

    Download and install the GPG key to verify the packages:

bash

wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

Verify the GPG key:

    Check that the key has been added correctly:

bash

gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg --fingerprint

Add the HashiCorp repository:

    This command sets up the repository so you can easily install Terraform and other HashiCorp tools:

bash

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list

Update package information from the new repository:

bash

sudo apt update

Install Terraform:

    Now that the repository is added, you can install Terraform:

bash

sudo apt-get install terraform

Verify the installation:

    Check that Terraform is installed correctly by listing its commands:

bash

    terraform -help

Summary:

    You first prepare your system and add HashiCorp's GPG key for security.
    Then, you add the official repository to easily install Terraform and other tools.
